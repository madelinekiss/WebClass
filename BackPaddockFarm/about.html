<p class="abouttxt col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6"> We are producers of 100% grass-fed beef log grown mushrooms. Through intensively managed rotational grazing and responsible agro forestry methods, we aim to create efficient strategies to improve our land and ecosystem in a way that mimics nature's perennial processes. Our goal is to produce good, healthy food and to share an understanding of our role in the natural world.

Back Paddock Farm is located in New Paltz, NY. Our farm was selected to participate in Glynwood's Hudson Valley Farm Business Incubator, which provides the tools and resources aspiring agricultural entrepreneurs need to develop and manage viable farm businesses in the Hudson Valley.</p>

<h1> Winter Beef CSA </h1> 

<p class="csatxt col-xs-12 col-sm-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6"> It's almost the end of September and we are celebrating our first growing season with long walks through the woods, the cooking of delicious meals, and the launch of our Winter CSA!  
We are committed to staying connected as we all transition into our winter routines.  We hope you come visit us at Poughkeepsie Grind on Main Street in Poughkeepsie every other Wednesday afternoon!  We will be there with shares of 100% grass-fed beef, raised by our partners at Harrier Fields Farm.  It will be warm and cozy, and we can talk fun winter recipes.  If this timing or location doesn't work for you, let us know, we can get creative.</p>
